# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Clipbee is a Chromium browser extension that helps users save text, images, and files from one computer to another. Allowing users to have a temporary storage place to allow them to access the files wherever the user is logged in with the extension. 

## Methods

When doing research for Clipbee we used many methods which helped us compare it to other applications out there to get a better understanding of what we can improve for Clipbee or make it stand out more compared to others. We first used competitive analysis in which we compared our extension to other extensions out there and other similar apps to see how we fair against them. As we noted the strengths of the applications and what they claimed to do, we selected 5 competitors that we felt were comparable to our product. 

The first method was making Personas and Scenarios. Personas allowed us to put a face on a user who may use the Clipbee extension, giving them backgrounds, personalities, and goals. With this information, we made Scenarios that involved placing the personas in situations that our extension could help them in. 

The second method we used was heuristic evaluation, in which we gathered infromation from a large pool of apps and tools that would be similar to what we are trying to accomplish with Clipbee. In this method we rate their strengths and weaknessesand gather ideas on what we should include, what we should avoid, and take inspiration for differing designs.

The third method we used was competitive analysis in which we chose Clipboard History which is an extension that can be found on the Chrome store, the reason for evaluating this extension is because it lines up with what Clipbee is trying to do and is one of the most used apps. Using [Neilsen's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) as a guideline we each gave it a wide range of ratings based on the categories of Visibility of System Status, Match between system and the real world, User control and freedom, Consistency and standards, Error prevention, Recognition rather than recall, Flexibility and efficiency of use, Aesthetic and minimalist design, Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors, and Help and documentation. We took notes on the strengths and weaknesses the extension had based on each category.

## Findings

The personas and scenarios helped us get insight on our customers who will have our extension. This gives us insights into how they would use our extension on their computer, what type of usability would be most important to them, and that we want a fast application. Something in common between all of our users is that users would want something done in the spur of the moment. 

Throughout our competitive analysis, we found that the individuals who might use our extension were quite broad. At first, we thought that our primary demographic would be students but after our analysis, we saw that instead of having a large primary user base of students we had a broad user base of students, artists, programmers, and office workers. We also saw that users preferred having a free tool over a paid one and that what held a lot of these tools back was the limited availability across platforms.

The findings in our heuristic evaluation found that Clipboard History was very good in the aspects of the look but failed at the Flexibility and efficiency of use and Help and documentation due to it being hard to use and with little documentation of how to use the extension. While everything else was a good 8 to 10 as it worked quite well. It followed the recognizable formatting of an email system but lacked in having tools to boost efficiency. Its aesthetics lacked because although the email system format is recognizable it might give users a negative reaction because of their own previous experiences with their personal email. It also doesn't do much to help users out with errors, most notably in the event of an accidental deletion and the lack of recovery points. Finally, it lacked any official documentation of the extension, or at least easily found documentation, the most it had was a web page that served more as a highlight for its features rather than instructions and explanation on how they work.

## Conclusions

Our personas and scenarios showed us that users would want a quick and responsive extension that is easy to not only use but also set up. An office environment would be hesitant to introduce a new tool if it takes too much time to explain to the workers and an artist or programmer wants to be able to switch between environments quickly when they are doing work.

The competitive analysis showed us that even though there are paid tools that do similar work people still prefer using a free even if it limits their accessibility. This is important to note because it shows there is a market for a good free extension that prides itself on it accessibly across platforms. We also found that focusing on the student's needs shouldn't overshadow the needs of our other users because we have a broad range of them.

Our heuristic evaluation on Clipboard History gave us insight into some do's and don't for our extension. One of the more important things we agreed on was having easy-to-get recovery points for our extension in the event of an accidental deletion. Another thing was how recognizable email formatting is but also how it could create a negative response to users. So potentially punching up the UI to make it less recognizable as an email inbox or steering away from using the formation could be a good response. We also want to have proper documentation on how the extension works and provide tools like shortcut keys to create a faster workflow. The shortcut keys would help our seasoned users to work faster and proper documentation would help our newer users to eventually grow into seasoned users if they so choose.

## Caveats

We have a good amount of limiting factors when it come to our research and how accurate they can be. Firstly we both are students in the same field so we tend to have similar thought processes, although we did find some differences when we consolidated our research we shouldn't assume that we covered all of our bases. Secondly we lack any credible data and a lot of this phase was making assumptions to get an idea of which direction we want to go with this extension. Finally we are doing low-cost research in terms of money and time, we haven't taken a closer look at our paid competitors and how they match up with the free ones and haven't talked to potential users about what they would like to see in an application.
