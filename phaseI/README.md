# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Clipbee is a chromium browser extension which helps users save text, images, and files from one computer to another. Allowing users to have a temporary storage place to allow them to access the files to whereever the user is logged in on with the extension. 

## Methods

When doing research for Clipbee we used many methods which helped us compare it to other applications out there to get a better understanding on what we can improve for Clipbee or make it stand out more compared to others. We first used competitive analysis in which we compared our extension to other extensions out there and other similar apps to see how we fair against them. As we noted the strengths of the applications and what they claimed to do, we selected 5 competitors that we felt were comparalbe to our product. 

The second method we used was heuristic evaluation, we chose one competitor from the competitive analysis method who we felt compared much more to our product. The reason for heuristic analysis on the competitior is to see how users react to the app, the feel of the app, how it looks, how much can users do with the app, and of course how it'll handle errors from the users. Clipboard history is the extension that can be found on the chrome store, the reason for us evaluating this extension is because it lines up with what Clipbee is trying to do. The extension was given a wide range of ratings based on the categories of Visibility of System Status, Match between system and the real world, User control and freedom, Consistency and standards, Error prevention, Recognition rather than recall, Flexibility and efficiency of use, Aesthetic and minimalist design, Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors, and Help and documentation. We toke notes on the strengths and weakness the extension had based on each category.

The third method was making personas, which allowed us to put a face on a user who may use the Clipbee extension. We made users with backgrounds, personalites, and goals. We made scenerios which invloved the personas in situations that our extension could help them in. 

## Findings

Throughout our commpetitive analysis, we found that the indiviuals who might use our extension was quite board. As although we first thought this might go for people in coding, like business people who need to share code across computers to a main workstation, this can also apply to students as well, but we discovered it could be used by many other people, like artists or people wanting to just share images or text across computers for the fun of it.

The findings in our heuristic evaluation found that Clipboard History was very good in the looks aspects but failed at the Flexibility and efficiency of use and Help and documentation due to it being hard to use and with little documentation of how to use the extenstion. While everything else was a good 8 to 10 as it worked quite well.

The personas and scenerios helped us get insight on our customers who will have our extenstion. Which gives us insights to how they would use our extenstion on their computer. And what type of usablility would be most important to them.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!


## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
