- **Cognitive Walkthrough** highlighted areas that had missing features that affect the functionality of the extension, such as **button feedback** to the user indicating what the user is doing as this would help out the user to indcate what they would need to do, cause there was a lack of indicaiton for the user, **copying and pasting** as it was unclear to where or not the user could copy and paste file into clipbee or if they need to copy just the text.
- [Wireframes](wireframes/) shows modifications to what previously was missing features
  - Feedback of what the user is doing to indicate **button feedback**
