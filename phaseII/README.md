# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Clipbee is a Chromium browser extension that helps users save text, images, and files from one computer to another. Allowing users to have a temporary storage place to allow them to access the files wherever the user is logged in with the extension. During this phase we found many things that helped us improved our ux side and the software side in the development of Clipbee.

## Methods

In our second phase we used Cognitive Walkthrough as our research method, which with our current wireframes and the personas we have written with scenarios was shared with other UX students for them to play out as the personas which would evaluate one of the given scenarios with the persona. This helped us figure out where those UX Students had trouble with figuring out where to go next after a given frame or if something was missing from our wireframe. The UX Students gave us a step by step of what they did to get to the stumpt or area that they had trouble with figuring out what to do after a certain frame was given to them. 

## Findings

The results in our Cognitive Walkthrough allowed us to see the problems with what users had trouble with. The UX students who help evaluate the Clipbee wireframe were able to complete some of the tasks of what Sam trying to send code. But they had trouble logging out from the extension and how to send code from a computer to one another. And with the lack of feedback that the extension gives will make the user upset as we only have it go one way or another.

## Conclusions

In conclusion our team made updated the frame to include a logout button if you enter the profiel page, we also took in the considersation of what we should improve for our next upcoming phase 3. We plan to make it that users get error code pop ups if they do something wrong and feedback when the user clicks on something.

## Caveats

Due to this being done by UX Students we didn't have what professionals would do, so this could be the UX Students not having many experiences performing walkthroughs. Our Wireframe could also be the other caveat we have due to wireframe being a concept of our main idea, it still left many things left to the imagination of the user which could've lead to more confusion onto how a user got to a page or what the icons are supposed to mean.
