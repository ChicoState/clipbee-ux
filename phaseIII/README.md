# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Clipbee is a Chromium browser extension that helps users save text, images, and files from one computer to another. This allows users to have a temporary storage place to access the files wherever the user is logged in with the extension. During this last phase, we made a prototype that would show us how users would interact with the extension.

## Methods

In our third phase, we conducted User Tests with Prototypes made from the feedback we got from phase two.

We made a prototype of [Clipbee](https://www.figma.com/proto/GA1JksosVFgs2GoxEYDzdU/Clipbee-Wireframe-Prototype?node-id=1-5217&t=FVGJo2PtIPMOWwax-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A5217) using Figma, which acted as an almost working replica of the extension we had envisioned. The prototype allowed us to implement buttons that led to different overlays of the extension and showed the separate pages of the profile. 

The prototype allowed us to do user testing for the extension. The user testing required a couple of things before we would get started. The first requirement was an [informed consent form](informed_consent_form.pdf) which we needed to gain the consent of our participants testing the extension. After they signed the consent form, we would then hand them the prototype and start the user test. Methodically going through our approved [protocol](protocol.pdf) and writing down notes on their expressions and demeanor. Asking them to complete tasks we've set to gauge how well the prototype performed. We also asked users to talk aloud, this was so their feelings were clear to us.

In the protocol we made sure we made it clear we were just evaluating the extension, we also timed how long it took for the users how long it took for them to finish. After each task, we asked how difficult the task felt from 1 to 5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy. 

In task 1, we asked the user to imagine a scenario where they have a snippet of an article from an online newspaper that they wanted to read, but they were already late for lunch with their friend. They want to save the snippet to read while at lunch with them. For this task, it was mainly the moderator showing the user the extension to see what they would do. And introducing them to a basic function the extension has in hopes of gauging their initial impression with it.

In task 2, we asked the user to imagine a scenario where they had to upload files from the computer onto the extension using the search file page. This was to test how easy it is to get to the files page and if any icons confused our users.

In task 3, we asked the user to delete those files, and then we asked them to recover them from the user profile. This was to gauge how a user would go about trying to find the recovery portion of the app, since it's in the user profile section.

Once we were done collecting the data from the users, we typed the users' time and if they successfully finished the tasks with a yes or no into a [google sheet](UX_Data.pdf) where we also saved comments that we found quite interesting from the users.

We ended up taking a more summative approach because we wanted to make sure that we could get as much feedback from our participants in the short window of time that we had them. So we focused more on collecting data during testing and coming together after the testing to assert our findings.

## Findings

The results of our user testing showed us that we needed a lot more work on the prototype and the eventual completion of the extension, as most of our participants had trouble finding the button to the search page, while some couldn't figure out how to find the user profile. A notable comment that we got about that was that a user didn't even realize it was there, and the button we used as a back button confused users because it didn't have any form of indication that it was a back button. A piece of positive feedback was that users liked the theme we were trying to go for. That being said, most users also said that this extension would be useful, but it needed to be more fleshed out before they would add it to their daily workflows and lives.


## Conclusions

The user test revealed a lot of issues and oversights that we missed when planning out the prototype. Those comments helped us see what could be improved for the design of Clipbee, like giving buttons more clarity in their function. Based on comments and time, we saw that Clipbee suffered from having a theme that overshadowed functionality. The bee-themed icons didn't offer any indication of what they were meant to do. Users responded positively to our attempted theme only after they realized that our buttons were bee themed. We took this feedback and concluded that the bee theme responded well to our users, but we need to revise our icons to show what their functionality is.

## Caveats

Due to how Figma works, it limited the amount of functions we could've had Clipbee, making it harder for users to do certain tasks that we wanted them to do. Plus, as UX students, this was also our first time giving this type of test, making it very likely we missed certain things that might've been important to updating the extension to improve it better in the future.

Our participants were also fellow UX students who have worked with Figma, so we don't have information on users who have no experience with Figma, or more importantly, UX design.
