# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Clipbee is a Chromium browser extension that helps users save text, images, and files from one computer to another. This allows users to have a temporary storage place to access the files wherever the user is logged in with the extension. During this last phase, we went to make a prototype that would show us how users would interact with the extension.

## Methods

In our third phase, we used Prototypes which led to User Testing of the extension.

We made a prototype of [Clipbee](https://www.figma.com/proto/GA1JksosVFgs2GoxEYDzdU/Clipbee-Wireframe-Prototype?node-id=1-5217&t=FVGJo2PtIPMOWwax-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A5217) using figma which acted as almost working replica of the extension we have invision. The prototype allowed us to to implement buttons which led to different overlays of the extension and showed the seperate pages of the profile. 

The prototype led to user testing the extension. The user testing required a couple of things before we would get started with the user testing our extension. The first thing whichw as required was an [informed consent form](informed_consent_form.pdf) which we needed to gain the consent of the user who's testing the extension. After they signed the consent form, we would hand them the prototype as we would use the [protocol](protocol.pdf) to write down notes and ask them to do certain tasks that we made for them typed out on protocol.

In the protocol we made sure we made it clear we were just evulating the extension, we also timed how long it took for the users how long it took for them to finish. After that we checked to see how they felt on a difficulty on 1 to 5 where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy. 

In task 1 we asked the user to imagine a scenario where they have a snippet of an article from an online newspaper that they wanted to read but they 
were already late for lunch with their friend. They want to save the snippet to read while at lunch with them. For this task, it was mainly the moderator showing the user the extension to see what they would do.

In task 2 we asked the user to imagine a scenario where they had to upload files from the computer onto the extension using the search file page.

In task 3 we asked the user to delete those files and then after that we asked them to recover them from the user profile.

Once we were done collecting the data from the users, we typed the users time and if they successfully finished the tasks with a yes or no into a [google sheet](UX_Data.pdf) where we also saved comments that we found quite interesting from the users.


## Findings

The results of our user testing showed us that we needed a lot more work with the prototype and the eventual completetion of the extension, as mostly all of the users tests had trouble finding the button to the search page, while some couldn't figure out how to find the user profile. We also got a lot of commentary from the users who used the application on how they felt if certain features were a little more fleshed out and if they were wanting to use it if it got all the features they recommended to be fleshed out.


## Conclusions

The user test revealed a lot of issues and oversights that we missed when planning out the prototype. Those comments helped us see what could be improved for the design of clipbee and what each button does, plus keeping with what felt nice, like the background of the search files. 

## Caveats

Due to how figma is it limited the amount of functions we could've had clipbee do, making it harder for users to do certain tasks that we wanted them to do. Plus as UX students this was also our first time giving this type of test, making it quite likely we missed certain things that might've been important to updating the extension to improve it better in the future.
