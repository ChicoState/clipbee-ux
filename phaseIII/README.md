# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Clipbee is a Chromium browser extension that helps users save text, images, and files from one computer to another. This allows users to have a temporary storage place to access the files wherever the user is logged in with the extension. During this last phase, we went to make a prototype that would show us how users would interact with the extension.

## Methods

In our third phase, we used Prototypes which led to User Testing of the extension.

We made a prototype of Clipbee using figma which acted as almost working replica of the extension we have invision. The prototype allowed us to to implement buttons which led to different overlays of the extension and showed the seperate pages of the profile. 

The prototype led to user testing the extension. The user testing required a couple of things before we would get started with the user testing our extension, the first was an [informed conset form](informed_consent_form.pdf)
