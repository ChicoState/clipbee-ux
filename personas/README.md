29 year old male in San Jose, California
Software Developer at Cspace Coding
B.A. in computer science, studying for a master at UC Davis
Max loves his job at Cspace and the fact that he gets to works from home is even
better. He works a 7 to 5 job from Monday to Thursday but that’s when the days are alright
for him. He likes to spend his free time working on personal coding projects and playing on
his xbox. He lives with his girlfriend Susan who shares a love in coding and video games like
he does.
He codes for his personal project but he wants to share his work with his colleagues
and friends who finds his work interesting and unique, the issue arises when he can’t send
the files over discord or has his cloud storage full already.

**Stephanie**

20 year old self-employed Artist in Los Angeles, California
Works per commission
Stephanie works at home, making art for her clients to pay her bills. She is very
successful and gets her commissions filled when she opens them. In her free time, she
likes to read and take care of her house plants. She likes her free time so the faster she
gets her work done the more time she has for herself. She works between a lot of different
devices and even sometimes gets flashes of inspiration when she takes a break to scroll
through her feeds.

**James**

40 year old office worker in Orlando, California
Works alongside his team mates to deliver statistics to the Analytics department
James spends a lot of time at work make spread sheets and organizing files sent to
him. He enjoys his work has built a system to optimize his workflow. He is always looking
for programs and equipment to finish his work faster. Because when he finishes his
deliverables, he ends up still getting paid for his time in the office.

# Scenarios

**Max finishes work**
It’s been a longer day than usual for Max as he’s been working on a giant project while on a
discord call with his colleagues. Max has finally finished his side of the project, but he
realizes he can’t send it over discord cause his code exceeds the regular discord file limit
and he doesn’t want to pay for nitro. He wishes he could just share his portion of the code
with them right there, right now.

**Stephanie wants to modify something**
Stephanie got a job where her client liked her style and wanted her to push her on spin on
the piece. While scrolling through her feeds she finds some nice flowers that she could use
to model but doesn’t like their color. She can modify them on her Windows computer but
the picture she found is on her Iphone. She often finds herself in this situation. It usually
ends up with her spending extra time trying to find the exact same picture again eating into
her personal time. She wishes she could have an easier time of sending photos to other
devices.

**James wants to improve his system**
Over the years James has built an impressive system, and he proved it by always getting his
work done on time. But he always faces the issue of having to wait for other departments to
fax or email him files. He would like some sort of bin where the departments could send
him files easily but the issue is a lot of people aren’t as computer literate as he is so he
needs to find something simple, easy to set up, and easy to use.
